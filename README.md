# What it uses?
<ol>
  <li>SASS</li>
  <ul>
    <h3>Why SASS?</h3>
    Sass is a good extension for CSS, it allows you to use awesome features like imports, mixins, operators, and the most important feature, <b>variables</b>!
  </ul>
  <li>AngularJS</li>
  <ul>
    <h3>Why AngularJS?</h3>
    AngularJS is a javascript framework that extends HTML static and very boring features, it gives you a awesome set of services, and modules, and allow you to construct your own modules and services to construct great dynamic webapps.
  </ul>
  <li>GRUNT</li>
  <ul>
    <h3>Why GRUNT.js?</h3>
    I choosen GRUNT because is a tool to automatize tasks that repeat over and over again,
    this tool makes easy to minify you HTML, CSS and JS codes, take away comments, generate CSS from SCSS(Sass) files and provides a lot of plugins to work with, it is a really powerful tool, and I like it.
  </ul>
</ol>
